        <p>Those, who doesn’t dream of flying, will grow no wings…</p>
        <p>I always thought my dream was to be a traditional archaeologist, unravelling the past in the field and at the desk.
        To follow that dream I graduated in archaeology and continued with a PhD in Roman archaeology. I even cut my teeth on research and training
        for the university of Mainz. However, I felt like there must be more: more to discover, more to learn! That’s when I decided to dream of flying.

        I started a 15 week coding bootcamp and I caught fire coding. Why? Because it incorporates creativity and problem solving, and I appreciate every new challenge.
        My specialties are learning new skills and programming languages quickly, problem solving and contemporary (responsive) design principles.
        So far, I’ve learned HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Vanilla JS, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, SQL/NoSQL and Git/GitHub and will learn React Native in the coming weeks.
        I’m keen to grab onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles to discover this whole new world of coding and to let my wings grow.
