        <p>Those, who don’t dream of flying, will grow no wings…</p>
        <p>I always thought my dream was to be a traditional archaeologist, unravelling the past in the field and at the desk.
        To follow that dream, I graduated in archaeology and continued with a PhD in Roman archaeology. I even cut my teeth on research and training
        for the university of Mainz. However, I felt like there must be more: more to discover, more to learn! That’s when I decided to dream of flying.

        I've started a 15 week coding school and have become completely hooked. Why? Because it incorporates creativity and problem solving, and I appreciate every new challenge.
        My specialties are learning new skills and programming languages quickly, problem solving and an agile mindset.
        So far, I’ve learned HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Vanilla JS, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, SQL/NoSQL and Git/GitHub.
        I’m keen to grab onto any other programming languages, frameworks, principles, or methods to discover this whole new world of web development and to let my wings grow.
